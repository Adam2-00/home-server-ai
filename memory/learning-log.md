**Type:** success-pattern

### What Worked
User asked me to create a self-improvement skill that learns from mistakes in real-time.

### Why It Worked
This is a meta-learning loop — the agent can now capture feedback immediately and evolve rather than waiting for periodic reviews.

### How to Reinforce
- Always check learning-log.md before responding
- Log feedback instantly when given
- Propose SOUL.md updates when patterns emerge
