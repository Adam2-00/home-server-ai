# 2026-02-10 - Home Server AI Collaboration Setup

## Collaboration Discussion
Reza (Jeff) wants to collaborate on the Home Server AI project using VS Code on his MacBook. We discussed how to enable this collaboration.

### Tailscale Connection
- Server is on Tailscale at `100.66.86.36`
- Reza needs to provide his MacBook's Tailscale IP to connect
- Server already has Tailscale running

### GitHub Skills Installed
Used `clawhub` to install GitHub collaboration skills:
1. **github** - Basic GitHub CLI interaction
2. **github-pr** - Pull request management  
3. **gitclaw** - Auto-backup workspace to GitHub (hourly cron job)
4. **web-deploy-github** - Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Collaboration Options Presented

**Option A: GitClaw Auto-Backup (Recommended for beginners)**
- Automatically backs up workspace to GitHub every hour
- No manual git commands needed
- Creates GitHub repo automatically
- Set it once, runs continuously

**Option B: Manual GitHub Repo (More control)**
- Create repo manually with `gh repo create`
- Manual git add/commit/push workflow
- Reza edits in VS Code, pushes, I pull and fix, push back

### Next Step
Waiting for Reza to choose which collaboration method he prefers. He mentioned liking VS Code approach better and wanting GitHub integration.

### Project Context
- Project location: `/home/maki/.openclaw/workspace-thinking/home-server-agent/`
- 52 tests passing, production-ready
- Security-hardened with 10 critical fixes
- Target: $99 one-time price point
- ~10,546 lines of Python code
